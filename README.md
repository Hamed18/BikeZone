## Main Functionalities (45 Marks)

### 1. User Registration & Authentication (Role-Based)

- **Secure Registration and Login**:
  - Users can register with the following fields: name, email, and password. By default, the registered user will have the "customer" role.
  - Note: You will have to manually update a user to "admin." No need to implement a "super admin" functionality.
  - Passwords must be securely hashed before storing in the database.
  - Users can log in using their email and password.

- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**:
  - Generate a JWT token upon login for secure authentication.
  - Store the token in **local storage** to maintain user sessions.

- **Logout**:
  - Clear the token from **local storage** upon logout and redirect the user to the login page.
